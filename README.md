This work implements a Bidirectional LSTM model for text classification to predict internal status based on external status descriptions, achieving an impressive 97.75% accuracy. It involves data preprocessing, tokenization, padding, model building, training, and evaluation. The high accuracy demonstrates the model's effectiveness in learning patterns from text data. Future improvements could include hyperparameter tuning, data augmentation, transfer learning, error analysis, deployment, multi-label classification, and explainable AI techniques.
